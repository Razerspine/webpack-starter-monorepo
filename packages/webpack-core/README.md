# @razerspine/webpack-core

Core webpack configuration and loaders for modern **Pug-based** projects.

## Designed for

This package is developed as part of the  
[Webpack Starter Monorepo](https://github.com/Razerspine/webpack-starter-monorepo).

templates, but **can also be used independently** in custom setups.

## Features

- ✅ Pug templates support (via `pug-plugin`)
- ✅ JavaScript / TypeScript scripts
- ✅ SCSS / Less styles
- ✅ Environment-aware configuration
- ✅ No hardcoded aliases or UI-kit dependencies
- ✅ Production-safe defaults (no aggressive chunk splitting)

npm install @razerspine/webpack-core
