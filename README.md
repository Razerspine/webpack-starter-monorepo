## 🎨 Theming System

The project uses a native **CSS Variables** approach for theming.

You can customize theme colors in:

```

```

The theme toggle logic is located in:

```
src/assets/scripts/modules/theme-toggle.js
```

The selected theme is saved to **localStorage** and restored on page reload.
